    "## Biological Neuron\n",
    "It is an unusual-looking cell mostly found in animal brains. It’s composed of a cell body containing the nucleus and most of the cell’s complex components, many branching extensions called dendrites, plus one very long extension called the axon. The axon’s length may be just a few times longer than the cell body, or up to tens of thousands of times longer. Near its extremity the axon splits off into many branches called telodendria, and at the tip of these branches are minuscule structures called synaptic terminals (or simply synapses), which are connected to the dendrites or cell bodies of other neurons. Biological neurons produce short electrical impulses called action potentials (simply signals) which travel along the axons and make the synapses release chemical signals called neurotransmitters. When a neuron receives a sufficient amount of these neurotransmitters within a few milliseconds, it fires its own electrical impulses\n",

    "## Artificial Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial networks are inspired by the human brain and how it is interconnected. They both have neurons, activations, and large interconnectivity. However, it is not a perfect comparison as the underlying process is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images\\bio vs ai.png' height='300px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to what we saw in logistic regression, the only difference is that in logsitic regresssion what we call the activation function was a sigmoid. In neural networks, there is a wide variety of activation functions to choose from. We will discuss activation function later in this lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within a neural network, each neuron performs a computation akin to logistic regression. It takes input from the previous layer, applies weights to these inputs, sums them up, and then applies an activation function. This process resembles the calculation in logistic regression where features are weighted and summed before being passed through a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shallow neural network would have only 2 layers, one hidden and one output layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images\\shallow network.png' height='300px'>\n",

    "**- Learning Complex Patterns:** By linking multiple neurons together in layers, neural networks can capture intricate patterns and relationships in the data. While logistic regression is limited to linear relationships, neural networks excel at modeling nonlinearities due to their layered structure and the activation functions applied at each neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Scaling Complexity:** Just as complex structures can be built from simple building blocks, neural networks scale the capabilities of logistic regression by layering multiple logistic regression units. Each layer adds another level of abstraction, allowing the network to learn increasingly complex representations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Neuron:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Inputs:** Neurons receive input signals from the previous layer or directly from the input data. These inputs represent the features of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Weights:** Each input feature is associated with a weight, which determines its importance in the computation. Just like logistic regression assigns coefficients to features, neural networks adjust weights during training to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Activation Function:** After summing the weighted inputs, the neuron applies an activation function. This function introduces nonlinearity into the model, allowing neural networks to learn complex mappings between inputs and outputs. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression, as well as others like Softmax, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and tanh.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Output:** Finally, the neuron produces an output value, which is transmitted to the next layer of neurons. In classification tasks, this output typically represents the probability of a certain class, just as logistic regression outputs probabilities for binary classification problems.\n",

They enables neural networks to learn intricates patterns in data, breaking away from solely linear relationships. By introducing non-linearities, activation functions empower neural networks to capture and understand complex mappings between inputs and outputs. Without them, the network's capacity to learn would be limited.\n",

    "\n",
    "From what we already saw, we can already tell that a single layer neural network is just like logistic regression, so we can simply use gradient descent to update the weights and biases, and it is straight forward to implement. However, it is more much more complicated for deeper networks. It was complicated enough that it took about 30 years before researchers figured out how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years researchers struggled to find a way to train neural networkss without success. But in 1986, David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams published a groundbreaking paper that introduced the backpropagation training algorithm, which is still used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it is Gradient Descent using an efficient technique for computing the gradients automatically in just two passes through the network (one forward, one backward), the backpropagation algorithm is able to compute the gradient of the network’s error with regard to every single model parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it can find out how each connection weight and each bias term should be tweaked in order to reduce the error. Once it has these gradients, it just performs a regular Gradient Descent step, and the whole process is repeated until the network converges to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images\\backprop_diagram.png' height='500px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the forward pass through the network, our data and operations go from bottom to top here. We pass the input $x$ through a linear transformation $L_1$ with weights $W_1$ and biases $b_1$. The output then goes through the sigmoid operation $S$ and another linear transformation $L_2$. Finally we calculate the loss $\\ell$. We use the loss as a measure of how bad the network's predictions are. The goal then is to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the weights with gradient descent, we propagate the gradient of the loss backwards through the network. Each operation has some gradient between the inputs and outputs. As we send the gradients backwards, we multiply the incoming gradient with the gradient for the operation. Mathematically, this is really just calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights using the chain rule.\n",

    "## The Basics of Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow uses arrays called tensors. A tensor is a multidimensional array of the same data type. A tensor can be a scalar (single number), a vector, or a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are like NumPy arrays, except that tensors have GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) support.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical tensor has the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: The length or number of elements of each of the tensor dimension/axes.\n",
    "- Rank: The number of dimensions/axes in a tensor. A scalar tensor (a single number) has rank 0, a vector has a rank 1 (a vector is a 1D), and a matrix has rank 2 (or 2D).\n",
    "- Axis/Dimension: This is a particular dimension of a tensor\n",
    "- Size: This is the total number of items in the tensor.\n",
    "  \n",
    "But why use tensor/NumPy arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, almost all types of data can be represented as an array of numbers. Take an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An Image can be represented as an array of pixels.\n",
    "- Any text data can be converted into an array of numbers (or tokens representing words)\n",
    "- Video (made of sequence of images) can be represented as an array of numbers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Having the ability to convert these raw data into tensors/arrays make it easy to preprocess it, either when performing conventional numerical computations or when it is the data we are preparing to feed to a machine learning model. Take a simple example, we can not feed a raw text to a machine learning model. That text has to be converted into numbers."
